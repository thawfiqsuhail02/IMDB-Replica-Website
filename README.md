# IMDB-Replica-Website
IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database)[1] is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
As of December 2020, IMDb has approximately 7.5 million titles (including episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database,[2] as well as 83 million registered users.
So, I as an practice for web development, I decided to clone this popular websites UI.
